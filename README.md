We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-lightsail/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "lightsail" {
      source        = "clouddrove/lightsail/aws"
      version       = "1.3.0"
      environment   = "test"
      name          = "lightsail"
      key_pair_name = "testing"
      label_order   = ["name", "environment"]
   }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| availability\_zone | The Availability Zone in which to create your instance | `string` | `"ap-south-1a"` | no |
| blueprint\_id | The ID for a virtual private server image | `string` | `"ubuntu_20_04"` | no |
| bundle\_id | The bundle of specification information | `string` | `"nano_2_1"` | no |
| create\_static\_ip | Create and attach a statis IP to the instance | `bool` | `false` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| domain\_name | This is the name of the resource. | `string` | `"mydomain.com"` | no |
| environment | Environment, e.g. 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', 'pre-prod', 'UAT' | `string` | n/a | yes |
| instance\_count | Number of instances to launch. | `number` | `1` | no |
| instance\_enabled | Flag to control the instance creation. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| key\_pair\_name | The key name to use for the instance. | `string` | `""` | no |
| key\_path | Public key path  (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| lightsail\_enabled | Flag to control the lightsail instance creation. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove'. | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| pgp\_key | Flag to control the instance creation. | `any` | `null` | no |
| port\_info | n/a | <pre>list(object({<br>    protocol = string<br>    port     = number<br>    cidrs    = list(string)<br>  }))</pre> | `null` | no |
| public\_key | The public key material. This public key will be imported into Lightsail. | `string` | `""` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-lightsail"` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | `map(any)` | `{}` | no |
| use\_default\_key\_pair | Default key pair name will be used, you must keep 'key\_pair\_name' empty | `bool` | `true` | no |
| user\_data | launch script to configure server with additional user data | `string` | `""` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| arn | The ARN of the Lightsail instance. |
| created\_at | The timestamp when the instance was created. |
| id | The ARN of the Lightsail instance. |
| ip\_address | The Ip Address name of the Lightsail instance. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
